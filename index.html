    <div class="executive-summary">
        <b>Executive Summary</b><br>
        In 2025, an assertive escalation in US tariffs set in motion a new phase of global trade disorder. The United States raised its average tariff rate to 20.6%—the highest since 1910—and trading partners across the globe scrambled to adapt. India saw both headwinds and opportunities: facing losses in metals and gems, but standing out in chemicals, textiles, and pharmaceuticals. These actions have forced massive readjustments worldwide, remapping trade and impacting everything from local prices to global growth forecasts.

    <h2 id="us-tariff-policy">1. US Tariff Policy: Setting the Stage</h2>
    <div>
        The US decision in 2025 to raise tariffs to an <b>average of 20.6%</b> marked a historic inflection point. Sectors as diverse as steel, electronics, automobiles, and consumer goods were targeted with tariff increases between 25% and 50%—with China-centric imports facing direct and indirect rates up to 35%. In response, China imposed retaliatory tariffs of up to <b>125%</b>. These policy moves required companies and governments worldwide to reassess supply chains and market strategies in real time.
    </div>
    <div class="charts-commentary">
        These changes meant the end of "business as usual" in international trade. The impact radiated quickly through manufacturing and logistics networks, and businesses reacted by shifting sourcing strategies almost overnight.
    </div>

    <h2 id="us-impact">2. The Economic Ripple Effects in the US</h2>
    <div>
        <b>Consumer prices</b> surged, with core CPI up <b>2.1%</b> compared to the previous year, translating to <b>$2,800 less</b> in average household disposable income. The pinch was most keenly felt in everyday goods:
        <ul>
            <li>Shoes: <b>+44%</b></li>
            <li>Apparel: <b>+40%</b></li>
            <li>Automobiles: <b>+14.1%</b></li>
            <li>Food: <b>+4.1%</b></li>
        </ul>
        US companies responded with an unequivocal shift: over 50% diversified supply chains, while investment in domestic metals production topped $14B as shortages hit hard. Large shipments of copper (over 230,000 tonnes) were rerouted as traders flocked to exploit new price differentials.
    </div>
    <div class="charts-commentary">
        While some US sectors, like domestic metals, saw renewed investment and job growth, the net result was <b>higher prices</b>, lingering shortages, and global supply chain disruption.
    </div>

    <h2 id="india-pivot">3. India’s Pivot: Opportunities and Vulnerabilities</h2>
    <div>
        India’s trade reliance on the US—<b>18% of all exports</b>—made it vulnerable to American protectionism. The country experienced a <b>6.4% decline</b> in total exports to the US (a $5.76B loss), but also carved out strategic gains. The effects by sector included:

        The pivot was clearest in textiles, chemicals, and pharmaceuticals—all saw boosted US orders. Conversely, traditional strongholds like jewelry and metals were hurt by both tariffs and higher input prices.

    <h2 id="global-shifts">4. Global Trade Shifts in Context</h2>
    <h3>Latin America</h3>
    <div>
        Brazil’s share of global soy exports rose to <b>40%</b>, with China securing <b>70%</b> of its soybeans from Brazil. Argentina benefitted as well, with trade premiums and export records as US producers lost ground.

    <div class="tables-commentary">
        The rapid increase in Southeast Asian exports to America required these nations to review compliance and logistics standards. Margins were tempered, however, by the cost of imported raw materials, now subject to US and Chinese tariffs.
    </div>
    <h3>China & Europe</h3>
    <div>
        China’s exports to the US dropped <b>23.6%</b> in the first four months of 2025. Europe also faced increased competition and global price pressures, leading to internal supply chain tweaks and higher average input costs (up 7.2%).

    <h2 id="macro-markets">5. Macro and Commodity Market Outcomes</h2>
    <div>
        Trade upheaval contributed to pronounced macro volatility:
        <ul>
            <li><b>IMF</b> revised its world GDP growth projection from 3.3% to <b>2.8%</b></li>
            <li>Global trade volume fell by <b>3%</b></li>
            <li><b>Soybean</b> futures dropped 12% YTD, while <b>copper prices increased 8%</b></li>
            <li><b>Indian rupee volatility index up 9%</b> so far this year; similar trends across Southeast Asia</li>
        </ul>

    <h2 id="takeaways">7. Key Takeaways for the Future</h2>
    <div>
        The data illuminates a world of accelerating adaptation and persistent volatility. The United States has discovered both the power and cost of reshaping trade with tariffs; India’s exporters must stay nimble, betting on value-added industries and broadening their market base.  
        <br><br>
        South America’s ascent, Southeast Asia’s quick response, and the resilience of specialized Indian categories are a guide to navigating future disruptions. For policymakers and business leaders alike, early recognition and swift action are now the new currency of success in global trade.
